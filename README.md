Cellular-Explorer-Prototype
===========================

This is a proof of concept prototype for a mixed-rules cellular automata program.  To see what mixed rules can do,
press the "demo" button and then the "Play/Pause" button.  The "New Culture" button will generate an empty array
of Conway's Game of Life.  The "Randomize" button will set each cell's on/off state randomly.  The "Clear" button
sets all cells to the off state.  The "Edit State" button will allow you to turn cells on or off by clicking on them. 
Draging the mouse will invert the state of cells that are draged over while in the edit state mode.
The "Edit Cells" button will allow you to change the ruleset of each cell by clicking or dragging the mouse.  The 
spinner next to the "Edit Cells" button selects the type of cell that is created in the grid.
The rule sets are as follows:
Black: always off
White: always on
Red:  blinks on and off (starts on)
Blue:  blinks on and off(starts off)
Orange: cell changes state randomly
Green: Conway's Game of Life (B3/S2)
Pink:   turns on if an odd number of its neighbors are on (otherwise off)
Yellow: turns on if an even number of its neighbors are on (otherwise off)
To return to normal running after Editing the cells or their states, press "Play/Pause".
